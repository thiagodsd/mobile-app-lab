# Security Guidelines

## ðŸ”’ Security Checklist for Development

### Before Each Commit
- [ ] No hardcoded API keys, tokens, or secrets in source code
- [ ] All sensitive data uses environment variables
- [ ] `.env.local` is never committed (check `.gitignore`)
- [ ] No credentials in comments or console.log statements

### Environment Variables
- [ ] All Firebase config uses `REACT_APP_` prefixed variables
- [ ] `.env.example` is updated when new variables are added
- [ ] Production environment variables are secured separately
- [ ] No environment files (except `.env.example`) are committed

### Firebase Security
- [ ] API key is restricted to your domains only
- [ ] Firebase security rules are properly configured
- [ ] Analytics is properly configured if needed
- [ ] No sensitive data in Firebase Analytics events

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Search for patterns: `apiKey`, `secret`, `password`, `token`
- [ ] Verify no hardcoded URLs with credentials
- [ ] Check that error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Ensure logging doesn't capture sensitive data

### Regular Security Audits
- [ ] Run `npm audit` to check for vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] Review Firebase project settings and permissions
- [ ] Monitor access logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated

## ðŸš¨ Incident Response

If credentials are accidentally committed:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Regenerate all exposed credentials immediately
   - Force push cleaned history: `git filter-branch` or `git filter-repo`
   - Update all deployment environments with new credentials

2. **Investigation**:
   - Check git history: `git log --all --full-history -- "**/file_with_secrets"`
   - Search all branches: `git grep -r "sensitive_pattern"`
   - Review access logs for potential misuse

3. **Prevention**:
   - Update `.gitignore` rules
   - Add pre-commit hooks for credential detection
   - Team training on secure development practices

## ðŸ”§ Security Tools

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Consider `git-secrets` or `detect-secrets`
- **Environment management**: Use secure CI/CD variable storage
- **Monitoring**: Set up Firebase security monitoring
- **Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability scans

## ðŸ“ž Contact

For security concerns or incident reporting, contact the project maintainer immediately.
